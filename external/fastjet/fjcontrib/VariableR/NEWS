-- 1.0.1: Fixed memory management and potential dependency issue (thanks FJ authors)
-- 1.0.0: New release using FastJet contrib framework.  All of the code has been merged into the VariableR.hh and VariableR.cc files (whereas previously there were separate files for AKT, CA, and the CoreJetAlgorithm classes).  The example program runs both AKTVR and CAVR.
